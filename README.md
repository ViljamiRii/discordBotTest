# discordBotTest
Little test for discord bot using typescript


To use this as a backbone for your own projects follow these steps:

 - clone the repo
 - cd into the clone directory
 - npm install -g yarn                        // Run this to get yarn
 - npm init                                   // Run to initialize project
 - yarn add discord.js                        // Run to get framework
 - yarn add -D @types/node ts-node typescript // Run to get dependencies

And that should be about it.
